# This GitHub action publishes assets for release when a tag is created.
# It runs on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v1.0.1).
#
# Tags are automatically created by release-please when a Release PR is merged.
# See release-please.yml for the semantic versioning workflow.
#
# Releases are published to GitHub Releases only (not Terraform Registry).
