# This workflow uses release-please to automatically manage releases
# based on conventional commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
#
# When commits are pushed to main:
# - release-please creates/updates a Release PR with changelog
# - When the Release PR is merged, it creates a git tag
# - The tag triggers the release workflow (release.yml) to run GoReleaser
#
# Commit message format:
#   feat: add new feature      -> minor version bump (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
#   fix: fix a bug             -> patch version bump (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
#   feat!: breaking change     -> major version bump (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
#   chore: update deps         -> no release (unless combined with feat/fix)
